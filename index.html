        <p>David and Alfonso Guerrero are US Citizens, live in Minneapolis, and Cape Coral, FL (respectively), but that doesn’t mean we have lost connection with our family, friends, and former neighbors in Maracay, Venezuela. And that connection is what has driven Alfonso to start this foundation, and for David to reach out to his connections in Minnesota and beyond to help raise funds.
</p><p>
          Working in the education system in Maracay has given Nina, our sister, a front row seat to the how the country’s political climate and decline, has effected the kids in the classrooms. She has witnessed the decline of personal care of the kids, such as kids are coming in to school barefoot, in ragged, unwashed clothes, hair unkempt and in need of grooming, and most of all terribly hungry. Nina’s big heart and disgust at the state of her country has driven her to action. Nina, along with other family members, friends, and school workers, has organized a kid’s day off. It was greatly successful! They made meals for around 250 kids! They also had facepainting, games and other fun activities, not to mention a pop-up barber shop, to give the kids a day off from the harsh conditions that the nation is facing these days.
        </p><p>
          As many people may know, Venezuela is going through extreme political crisis and corruption. There is a lot of political unrest, demonstrations, and protests. The situation for the average person is trying to hold on and survive while crisis is all around. Many Venezuelans have opted to leave the country. Those that remain, such as our family members, are struggling to maintain a “normal” life, and to get the basic neccessities. On a daily basis, people have to stand in line for hours for groceries, and when they get to the front of the line, they end up paying super inflated prices, or the store may be out of many items.
        </p><p>
          We were raised in a giving, sharing, and caring family. As kids that was enforced upon us - if one of us got a candy bar, we had to share it with the other 7 siblings (even when that was the last thing we wanted to do!). And even though right now, our family is struggling to get by, to get life’s basic neccessities, the first thing on their minds is how can they increase the little that they have, and share it with all those around. The first kid’s day off was hugely successful! And so they want to be able to put on more events like this, to be able to ease the pain and the hunger of the neighborhood, even if for a short time. We hope to raise funds for these events that help to bring some cooked meals, and other neccessities to the neighborhood. We also hope that the conditions in the country change for the better and we will no longer need these donations.
